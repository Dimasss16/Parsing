# Parsing

This project utilizes Python libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, and `lxml` to:

- Parse websites containing English idioms and their corresponding Russian translations.
- Extract the idioms and translations as data.
- Structure the extracted data into Pandas DataFrames.
- Export the DataFrames as CSV files for further analysis or use.
